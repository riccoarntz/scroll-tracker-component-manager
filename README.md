## Building

In order to build scroll-tracker-component-manager, ensure that you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js]
(http://nodejs.org/) installed.

Clone a copy of the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/riccoarntz/scroll-tracker-component-manager.git
```

Change to the vue-transition directory:
```sh
cd scroll-tracker-component-manager
```

Install dev dependencies:
```sh
yarn
```

Use one of the following main scripts:
```sh
yarn build           # build this project
yarn dev             # run dev-watch mode, serving example/index.html in the browser
yarn generate        # generate all artifacts (compiles ts, webpack, docs and coverage)
yarn test:unit       # run the unit tests
yarn validate        # runs validation scripts, including test, lint and coverage check
yarn lint            # run tslint on this project
yarn doc             # generate typedoc documentation
```

When installing this module, it adds a pre-push hook, that runs the `validate`
script before committing, so you can be sure that everything checks out.
